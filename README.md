# Introduction
This is a Complete Project I made using a very large sized dataset of about 100000 Records and 26 columns.

# Dataset Description:
- The dataset is a bank data set that is very large and contains a lot of columns that have missing values and outliers in most columns, Also the dataset had a lot of uncommon patterns that made the columns
that are supposed to be numerical columns, but are object columns instead.

# Dataset Cleaning:

I've cleaned and handled all the missing values in the dataset appropriately and check for duplicates.
- The dataset before cleaning and fixing the broken columns:
